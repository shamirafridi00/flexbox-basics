# flexbox-basics

1. Use display: flex; to create a flex container.
2. Use justify-content to define the horizontal alignment of items.
3. Use align-items to define the vertical alignment of items.
4. Use flex-direction if you need columns instead of rows.
Use the row-reverse or column-reverse values to flip item order.
5. Use order to customize the order of individual elements.
6. Use align-self to vertically align individual items.
7. Use flex to create flexible boxes that can stretch and shrink.

I have followed this tutorial step by step and tried to covered and understand each concept. My concepts are little bit rusty regarding flexbox but atleast on the higher level I can now know they work. In the coming days, I need to build something up by myself.
